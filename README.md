# Towards a Predictive Weather Model Using Machine Learning In Tenerife (Canary Islands)
This repo contains a set of R scripts for preprocessing, transformation, training, optimization and validation. We used the caret package (Classification and Regression Training) (Khun, 2008). Caret is an interface that unifies under just one framework several machine learning packages, making data preprocessing, training, optimization and validation of predictive models easier and with native support for parallel calculations (Khun & Johnson, 2013).
